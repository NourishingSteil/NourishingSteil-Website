      <h1>About Tracy</h1>
      <p>
        As a health coach certified through the Institute of Integrative Nutrition, I offer a rounded approach of supportive practices. I specialize in gut and brain health. Helping calm stress, stabilize moods and sustain balance is my passion.
        <br>
        I love continuously learning and sharing ways to think and feel better, and how to get in touch with what works on a personal level. Seeing the impact of diabetes, inflammation, and chronic pain in family members has spurred interest in understanding what can really help. I support knowing and applying how to improve balance of energy and manage stress.
        <br>
        Enjoying a more natural lifestyle, I have been gardening, preserving food, and raising chickens. Traditional cooking has also been a growing experience, with sprouts, fermenting, and starters in the kitchen. My cooking is enjoyed with seasonings, bone broths and fresh produce.
    ​    <br>
        I’m a mother of four, including one on the autism spectrum. I have seen and experienced how depression, anxiety, and insomnia impacts relationships. Brain and hormonal health focus became a driver of better food and lifestyle choices in our home.
